## Usage

- When your web browser is online, please add transactionâ€™s name and amount into the form, and click the Add Funds button or the Subtract Funds button to create a withdrawal or deposit transaction. The transaction data will be cached in `Cache Storage` (`data-cache-v1`) frontend, and also will be stored in `MongoDB` backend.

- When your web browser is offline, the application is unable to create the withdrawal or deposit transaction in the `MongoDB` backend, it will make a request to `IndexedDB` to store the transaction data in the `pending` object store. When the application comes back online, the data in `IndexedDB` will be cached in `Cache Storage` (data-cache-v1) and will be written to `MongoDB` to be rendered in the `UI` again.

- This application is also be designed as a progressive web application (`PWA`). It can be installed through your web browser or mobile. Here is the screenshot of install function in the web browser as below:

## Business Context
